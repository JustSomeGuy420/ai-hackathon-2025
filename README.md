RECT | Real-Time Economic Conditions and Tariffs
Translating Global Economics into Personal Insights
Overview
AI Tariff Impact Simulator is a web application that helps individuals understand how global tariffs, inflation, and trade policies directly affect their daily expenses. By combining live economic data, AI-driven explanations, and interactive visualizations, the platform transforms complex trade information into easy-to-understand personal insights.
Problem
As global trade tensions rise, tariffs and inflation significantly impact the cost of everyday goods — but the reasons behind these changes are rarely clear to the average person. Economic data is often too complex, too abstract, or too impersonal. We built this tool to bridge that gap — empowering people to see why prices change, how it affects them, and what they can do about it.
Key Features
•	AI Insight Engine: Generates human-readable explanations of why prices have changed.
•	Economic Simulator: Allows users to model the effect of tariff or inflation changes on their personal expenses.
•	Insight Page: Simplifies economic data into digestible summaries and graphs with actionable suggestions.
•	Dashboard: Displays key metrics like inflation rate, tariff index, exchange rate impact, and purchasing power.
•	Login & Settings: Secure login with personalization features.
Tech Stack
•	Frontend: React.js (Tailwind, Framer Motion)
•	Backend: Node.js / Express.js
•	Database: MongoDB / Firebase
•	AI Logic: OpenAI API or local ML model
•	Visualization: Recharts / Chart.js
Team Roles
•	Alwyn Sterling/Tianna Bassaragh - Backend Developer: API, database, AI integration.
•	Tianna Bassaragh/Dellonte Boucher/ Azaria Da Silva - Frontend Developer: Dashboard, Insight, Simulator UI.
•	Azaria Da Silva/Dellonte Boucher - UI/UX Designer: Design, animation, responsiveness.
•	Azaria Da Silva/Dellonte Boucher - Data + AI Lead: Data gathering, modeling, insight logic.
Future Improvements
•	Integrate real-time Tariff schedules, Currency & CPI, News APIs, Crowdsourced price collection
•	Advanced AI reasoning for insight generation.
•	Personalized financial recommendations.
•	Mobile version and PDF report export.
Why This Project Stands Out
We translate the language of economics into human understanding. Unlike typical dashboards, our system explains the 'why' behind price changes, not just the 'what.' It combines AI storytelling, economic modeling, and interactive simulation to empower people facing inflation and trade stress.
